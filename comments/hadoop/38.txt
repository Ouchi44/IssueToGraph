Thank you Daniel Templeton and Robert Kanter for inputs   #3 since for upgrade case when we have running apps and havnt used distributed cache.  Need to modify only one config during upgrade and everything works as old.   Another case can happen when old clients try to submit apps too rt?     client doesn't have the same paths as the NM hosts, it won't work.    Daniel Templeton Thank you for bring this scenarios too had missed out.   Will do document update and upload patch soon.
