Akira Ajisaka      Agreed. If we are going to do this, we need to revert the documentation of MAPREDUCE-6702 and update the release note. Would you revert the documentation change in this issue?    My previous comment means I don't agree with the point. My thought is that it is not straight forward, and confusing. Hence, I think it should be {{ "HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME="Apps.crossPlatformify("HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME");}}. Could you tell me your thoughts?
