But since its a mapreduce property its not correct to add to the whitelist of yarn .    Why can't MR add it itself?    But since its a mapreduce property its not correct to add to the whitelist of yarn .    Who cares? It's all Apache Hadoop. Users have an expectation that this stuff will work out of the box and be consistent. They aren't going to say "Oh, of course this is completely broken! That part over there is YARN and that part over there is MAPREDUCE!"    IIUU HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME for default installation will be same as HADOOP_COMMON_HOME .    It's irrelevant. HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME is where the mapred stuff is guaranteed to be. There is no guarantee that HADOOP_COMMON_HOME is going to work. That's why there is a separate variable for it instead of just using HADOOP_COMMON_HOME everywhere. Either this should be HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME or set nothing at all.
