Bibin A Chundatt, would you like to update the patch to implement the approach (setting HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME to HADOOP_COMMON_HOME)?   One thing to note is that if the default is defined on the admin env and the user overrides it on the non-admin env things break because YARN would simply concatenate the values (see YARN-4789 and MAPREDUCE-6491). So until that is fixed it might be better to use mapred.child.env over mapreduce.admin.user.env.
