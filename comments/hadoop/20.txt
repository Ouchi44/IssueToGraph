Allen Wittenauer/Akira Ajisaka  Sorry for the delay.   As already mentioned the HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME is not part of env since not inherited to launcher.Adding        yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist="JAVA_HOME,HADOOP_COMMON_HOME,HADOOP_HDFS_HOME,HADOOP_CONF_DIR,CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE,HADOOP_YARN_HOME,HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME"       in yarn-site.xml of NM does solve the problem. But since its a mapreduce property its not correct to add to the whitelist of yarn .   IIUU HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME for default installation will be same as HADOOP_COMMON_HOME .  For layout change we can configure explicity mapred.child.env paths.   Till jira is fixed ,to make mapreduce job run add params as below       -Dmapred.child.env="HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME={{HADOOP_COMMON_HOME}}" -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.env="HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME={{HADOOP_COMMON_HOME}}"       Open to any other solution.
