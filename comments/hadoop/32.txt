Robert Kanter     Given the difficulty people seem to be having and that there doesn't seem to be a single fix that works for everyone for some reason, perhaps we should revisit that decision?     IMHO we have to rethink of the same.   Summarizing discussion and solutions     Add HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=HADOOP_COMMON_HOME in opts.But its not mandatory that MAPRED_HOME=HADOOP_COMMON_HOME   Add HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME to Yarn.Since we want to keep YARN and MAPRED separate initial solution was not accepted.   Add documentation to configure yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist in nodemanager to run mapred application     &lt;property&gt; &lt;name&gt;yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist&lt;/name&gt; &lt;value&gt;JAVA_HOME,HADOOP_COMMON_HOME,HADOOP_HDFS_HOME,HADOOP_CONF_DIR,CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE,HADOOP_YARN_HOME,HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME&lt;/value&gt; &lt;/property&gt;       Waiting for +1 for any one of above solution or inputs for any other approach
