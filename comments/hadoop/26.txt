Quite shocked that commit "9d4d30243b0fc" get merged without basic MRv2 test and even no YARN JIRA for it!    Zhankun Tang, commit "9d4d30243b0fc" when in to fix a security problem. That's why there's no JIRA and why it's shrouded in mystery.      Who cares? It's all Apache Hadoop. Users have an expectation that this stuff will work out of the box and be consistent. They aren't going to say "Oh, of course this is completely broken! That part over there is YARN and that part over there is MAPREDUCE!"    Allen Wittenauer, my original patch for "9d4d30243b0fc" did add HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME to Yarn and things did work out of the box. There was pushback to remove it because of the desire to keep Yarn and MR separate. Given the difficulty people seem to be having and that there doesn't seem to be a single fix that works for everyone for some reason, perhaps we should revisit that decision?
