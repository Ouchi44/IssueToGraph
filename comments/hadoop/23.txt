I encountered this issue too. Quite shocked that commit "9d4d30243b0fc" get merged without basic MRv2 test and even no YARN JIRA for it!  And it's strange that I still fail to run MRv2 application as well as Dockerized MRv2 application after tried the temporary solution mentioned by Bibin A Chundatt. YARN patch also not works for me.
