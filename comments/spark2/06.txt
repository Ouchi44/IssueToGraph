Xiangrui Meng Reza Zadeh Ok, thanks for the heads up. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything about the spec that should be handled differently. I covered most of the mathematics informally (the details are already covered formally in the references). And in addition, the proposal describes a method of implementing TFOCS functionality distributively but does not investigate existing distributed optimization systems.
