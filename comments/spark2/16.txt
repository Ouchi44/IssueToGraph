Thanks! Kai Sasaki I probably should have looked into this more carefully before your PR. It would be good to understand the best criterion. Regardless, I believe most of your PR's changes should carry over.   Aaron Staple Xiangrui Meng Do you know what the basis of the TFOCS stopping criterion is? I don't see that detail described in the paper.   Barring a better understanding...I guess I'd vote to mimic TFOCS.
