I believe this stopping criteria was added after the paper was written. It is documented on page 8 of the userguide (https://github.com/cvxr/TFOCS/raw/master/userguide.pdf) but unfortunately no explanation is provided. (The userguide also documents this as a &lt;= test, while the current code uses &lt;.) And unfortunately I couldnâ€™t find an explanation in the code or git history.   I think the switch to absolute tolerance may be because a relative difference measurement could be less useful when the weights are extremely small, and 1 is a convenient cutoff point. (Using 1, the equation is simple and the interpretation is clear.) I believe Xiangrui Meng alluded to switching to an absolute tolerance at 1 already (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/3636#discussion_r22078041) so he might be able to provide more information.   With regard to using the new weight norms as the basis for measuring relative weight difference, I think that if the convergence test passes using either the old or new weight norms, then the old and new norms are going to be very similar. It may not make a significant difference which test is used. (It may also be worth pointing out that in cases where the tolerance tests with respect to different old/new weights return different results, if the tolerance wrt new weights is met (and wrt old weights is not) then the weight norm increased slightly; if the tolerance wrt the old weights is met (and wrt new weights not) then we weight norm decreased slightly.)   Finally, TFOCS adopts a policy of skipping the convergence test on the first iteration if the weights are unchanged. I believe this condition is based on implementation specific behavior and does not need to be adopted generally.
