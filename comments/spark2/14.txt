Aaron Staple Kai Sasaki Can you please coordinate about how convergence is measured, as in SPARK-3382? The current implementation for SPARK-3382 uses relative convergence w.r.t. the weight vector, where it measures relative to the weight vector from the previous iteration. I figure we should use the same convergence criterion for both accelerated and non-accelerated gradient descent.
